# BMDExporter

BMDExporter is a tool for converting textured Wavefront OBJ (and later Collada DAE) model files into Nintendo's BMD model format. This format is used
in many popular GameCube and Wii games, such as Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.
